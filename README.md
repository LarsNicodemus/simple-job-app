# Simple Job App

This project is a simple job tracking app developed as part of the iOS module at the Syntax Institute. It is one of the apps created in the course and focuses on concepts such as **Databases**, **UserDefaults**, and **SwiftData** in SwiftUI. The app demonstrates how to persist data locally and manage it efficiently using modern Swift frameworks.

## About the App

The Simple Job App allows users to track job applications, including details like company name, job title, application status, and notes. The app showcases how to use **UserDefaults** for lightweight data storage and **SwiftData** for more complex data management, providing a seamless experience for managing job applications.

## Features

- **Job Application Tracking**: Add, edit, and delete job applications with details such as company name, job title, status, and notes.
- **Data Persistence**: Save and retrieve data using **UserDefaults** for simple key-value storage and **SwiftData** for more advanced database operations.
- **Application Status**: Track the status of each job application (e.g., Applied, Interviewing, Offered, Rejected).
- **Search and Filter**: Easily search and filter job applications by company name, status, or other criteria.

## Technologies and Concepts

- **UserDefaults**: Store lightweight data such as user preferences or settings.
- **SwiftData**: Manage complex data models and relationships using Swift's modern data persistence framework.
- **Data Binding**: Connect the UI to the data model for real-time updates.
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on job application data.

## Installation
